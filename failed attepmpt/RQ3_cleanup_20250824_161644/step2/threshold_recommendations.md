# Time Threshold & Interpolation Recommendations

## üìä **Data Analysis Summary**

### **Key Statistics**
- **Total Contributors**: 6,530
- **Length Range**: 1 to 1,220 weeks (extreme variance!)
- **Median Length**: 47 weeks
- **Project Difference**: OSS4SG contributors are 6x longer than OSS

### **Memory Impact**
- **Weekly Data**: 64.7 MB (1,274 time points)
- **Monthly Data**: 17.2 MB (321 time points) 
- **Memory Reduction**: 73% using monthly vs weekly

---

## üéØ **Final Recommendations**

### **üèÜ RECOMMENDED: Conservative Balanced Approach**
```python
min_length = 8 weeks      # Keep 4,254 contributors (65% retention)
target_length = 52 weeks  # 1 year interpolation
granularity = "weekly"    # Good temporal resolution
```

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ Keeps 65% of contributors (good sample size)
- ‚úÖ Filters out very short, noise-prone series
- ‚úÖ One year captures most engagement patterns
- ‚úÖ Computationally manageable (~15 MB)
- ‚úÖ Preserves weekly granularity for detailed analysis

### **Alternative Options**

| Configuration | Min Weeks | Target Length | Retention | Use Case |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Coverage** | 4 weeks | 26 weeks | 68% | Maximum data retention |
| **Conservative** | 8 weeks | 52 weeks | 65% | **Recommended balance** |
| **Quality** | 12 weeks | 52 weeks | 63% | High-quality patterns only |
| **Efficient** | 12 weeks | 12 months | 63% | Fast computation |

## üìà **Threshold Impact Analysis**

### **Data Loss by Minimum Threshold**
```
‚â•  1 week:  6,530 contributors (  0.0% loss) ‚Üê Includes noise
‚â•  4 weeks: 4,463 contributors ( 31.7% loss) ‚Üê Good coverage  
‚â•  8 weeks: 4,254 contributors ( 34.9% loss) ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
‚â• 12 weeks: 4,114 contributors ( 37.0% loss) ‚Üê High quality
‚â• 26 weeks: 3,739 contributors ( 42.7% loss) ‚Üê Too restrictive
‚â• 52 weeks: 3,170 contributors ( 51.5% loss) ‚Üê Major loss
```

### **Project Type Considerations**
- **OSS**: Median 16 weeks ‚Üí More affected by thresholds
- **OSS4SG**: Median 100 weeks ‚Üí Less affected by thresholds
- **Implication**: Higher thresholds may bias toward OSS4SG

## üîß **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Test with Recommended Settings**
```python
config = {
    "min_length": 8,      # weeks
    "target_length": 52,  # weeks  
    "sample_size": 500,   # contributors for testing
    "memory_limit": 4.0   # GB
}
```

### **Phase 2: Compare Alternatives**
Run multiple configurations to compare:
1. **Clustering quality** (silhouette scores)
2. **Computational efficiency** (time/memory)
3. **Pattern interpretability** (cluster characteristics)

### **Phase 3: Validate Results**
Use `testing_step2.py` to validate:
- DTW implementation correctness
- Clustering quality metrics
- Pattern interpretability
- Statistical significance

## üìã **Expected Outcomes**

### **With Recommended Settings (8 weeks ‚Üí 52 weeks)**
- **Dataset Size**: 4,254 contributors √ó 52 weeks
- **Memory Usage**: ~15-20 MB
- **Computation Time**: 5-15 minutes
- **Expected Clusters**: 3-6 distinct patterns
- **Quality**: Good balance of coverage and pattern clarity

### **Pattern Types Expected**
Based on the data characteristics:
1. **Early Burst**: High initial activity, then decline
2. **Steady Moderate**: Consistent low-moderate activity  
3. **Growing Engagement**: Increasing activity over time
4. **Intermittent**: Sporadic activity with gaps
5. **High Sustained**: Consistent high activity (mainly OSS4SG)

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Trade-off Analysis**

| Aspect | Shorter Threshold | Longer Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Sample Size** | Larger (more power) | Smaller (less power) |
| **Data Quality** | More noise | Less noise |
| **Pattern Clarity** | Lower | Higher |
| **OSS Representation** | Better | Worse |
| **Computation** | Slower | Faster |
| **Generalizability** | Better | More selective |

## üìù **Recommendation Summary**

**Use 8 weeks minimum threshold with 52-week interpolation** because:

1. **Scientific Validity**: Sufficient data for meaningful patterns
2. **Statistical Power**: Large enough sample (4,254 contributors)
3. **Balanced Representation**: Keeps reasonable mix of OSS/OSS4SG
4. **Computational Feasibility**: Manageable memory and time requirements
5. **Temporal Coverage**: One year captures most engagement cycles
6. **Pattern Resolution**: Weekly granularity for detailed analysis

This configuration provides the **best balance** between data quality, computational efficiency, and scientific rigor for your DTW clustering analysis.
