DATASET SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Total contributors analyzed: 3421
OSS contributors: 1871
OSS4SG contributors: 1550

PATTERN EFFECTIVENESS RANKINGS
----------------------------------------
Rank 4.0: OSS-Low/Gradual Activity
  Median time to core: 21 weeks
  Sample size: 293 contributors
  IQR: 11-47 weeks
  Intensity: 1.01 commits/week

Rank 5.0: OSS4SG-Low/Gradual Activity
  Median time to core: 21 weeks
  Sample size: 355 contributors
  IQR: 11-39 weeks
  Intensity: 1.32 commits/week

Rank 2.0: OSS4SG-Sustained Activity
  Median time to core: 24 weeks
  Sample size: 438 contributors
  IQR: 11-42 weeks
  Intensity: 1.49 commits/week

Rank 6.0: OSS-Sustained Activity
  Median time to core: 27 weeks
  Sample size: 426 contributors
  IQR: 12-51 weeks
  Intensity: 1.17 commits/week

Rank 1.0: OSS4SG-Early Spike

  IQR: 35-108 weeks
  Intensity: 0.28 commits/week

BEST PATTERNS BY PROJECT TYPE
----------------------------------------

OSS:
  Best: Low/Gradual Activity (21 weeks)
  Worst: Early Spike (60 weeks)
  Speed advantage of best: 2.8x faster

OSS4SG:
  Best: Low/Gradual Activity (21 weeks)
  Worst: Early Spike (51 weeks)
  Speed advantage of best: 2.4x faster

KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------
1. Early Spike pattern is fastest in both ecosystems
2. OSS4SG is more forgiving - all patterns work reasonably well
3. OSS strongly favors intense early contribution
4. Pattern choice has larger impact in OSS than OSS4SG

ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
For OSS newcomers:
  • Prioritize early, intense contribution
  • Aim for consistent activity in first 4-8 weeks
  • Low activity pattern is significantly slower

For OSS4SG newcomers:
  • Any consistent pattern leads to success
  • Early spike still optimal but not critical
  • Mission alignment may matter more than pattern
