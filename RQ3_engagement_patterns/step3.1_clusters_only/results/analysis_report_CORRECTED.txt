RQ3 Step 3.1 CORRECTED: CLUSTERS-ONLY ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================
Generated: 2025-08-24 17:57:34

CORRECTED PATTERN NAMES:
----------------------------------------
• Cluster 0: Early Spike (high activity early, then decreases)
• Cluster 1: Low/Gradual Activity (consistently low activity)
• Cluster 2: Sustained Activity (gradual increase over time)

DATASET SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Total contributors analyzed: 3421
OSS contributors: 1871
OSS4SG contributors: 1550

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Kruskal–Wallis H=686.672 p=0.000000
Scott-Knott ranking uses MEDIAN values (more robust to outliers)
Number of Scott-Knott ranks: 4

PATTERN EFFECTIVENESS RANKINGS (by MEDIAN)
----------------------------------------

Rank 1: OSS4SG-Late Spike
  Median time to core: 21 weeks
  Mean time to core: 32.3 weeks
  Sample size: 355 contributors
  IQR: 11-39 weeks

Rank 1: OSS4SG-Low/Gradual Activity
  Median time to core: 24 weeks
  Mean time to core: 33.2 weeks
  Sample size: 438 contributors
  IQR: 11-42 weeks

Rank 2: OSS-Low/Gradual Activity
  Median time to core: 27 weeks
  Mean time to core: 38.3 weeks
  Sample size: 426 contributors
  IQR: 12-51 weeks

Rank 3: OSS4SG-Early Spike
  Median time to core: 51 weeks
  Mean time to core: 65.4 weeks
  Sample size: 757 contributors
  IQR: 31-89 weeks

Rank 4: OSS-Early Spike
  Median time to core: 60 weeks
  Mean time to core: 74.4 weeks
  Sample size: 1152 contributors
  IQR: 35-108 weeks

KEY INSIGHTS (CORRECTED)
----------------------------------------
• Low/Gradual Activity is the FASTEST pattern (not Early Spike!)
• Early Spike is actually the SLOWEST in both ecosystems
• OSS4SG is more forgiving - multiple patterns work well
• Pattern choice has larger impact in OSS than OSS4SG
