# CORRECTED Treatment Metrics Analysis Report
**Generated on:** 2025-08-16 20:38:39

## Executive Summary
This analysis CORRECTS the methodological issues found in the original Step 3 analysis.

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Zero-Activity Bias**: Removed 41% of contributors with no PR/issue activity
2. **Activity Level Confounding**: Focused on active contributors only
3. **Population Mixing**: Clear separation of OSS vs OSS4SG

### Corrected Dataset:
- **Active Contributors**: 3837
- **OSS Active**: 2675
- **OSS4SG Active**: 1162

### Corrected Results:
- **Total Metrics Analyzed**: 10
- **OSS4SG Advantages**: 7 (7 significant)
- **OSS Advantages**: 3 (3 significant)

### Key Findings:
**OSS4SG Significant Advantages:**
- Merge Rate: 0.816 vs 0.804 (δ=-0.121)
- Approval Rate: 0.554 vs 0.500 (δ=0.162)
- First Response Time (hours): 763.828 vs 497.978 (δ=0.235)
- Average Response Time (hours): 1350.343 vs 934.601 (δ=0.174)
- Total Responses: 137.213 vs 91.120 (δ=0.369)
- Unique Responders: 9.197 vs 8.896 (δ=0.248)
- Positive Sentiment Rate: 0.155 vs 0.110 (δ=0.244)

**OSS Significant Advantages:**
- Response Rate: 0.690 vs 0.627 (δ=-0.190)
- Conversation Length: 3.728 vs 3.355 (δ=-0.050)
- Back-and-forth Turns: 3.112 vs 2.681 (δ=-0.079)

### Methodology:
- **Statistical Test**: Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric)
- **Effect Size**: Cliff's Delta
- **Population**: Active contributors only (PR or issue activity > 0)
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.05

### Conclusion:
The corrected analysis shows a more balanced picture compared to the original
analysis that was biased by zero-activity contributors. OSS4SG shows advantages
in several key metrics when comparing like-with-like (active contributors).
