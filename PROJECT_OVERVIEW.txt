STEP 10 (ML MODELING) - RECENT UPDATE
------------------------------------
The Step 10 ML pipeline (`RQ1_transition_rates_and_speeds/step10_ml_modeling/`) was rebuilt to use the master commits dataset and monthly core transitions. Summary:

- Contributors analyzed: 23,069
- Core contributors: 8,045 (34.9%)
- Projects covered: 358
- Best model (RandomForest): ROC AUC = 0.746, PR AUC = 0.657
- Top feature: `lines_changed_90d` (22.2% importance)

See `RQ1_transition_rates_and_speeds/step10_ml_modeling/README.md` for full details and reproduction scripts.


RESEARCH GOAL
=============
Study developer transitions from newcomer to core contributor in conventional
OSS vs OSS for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects. Focus on RQ1: transition rates
and speeds; later RQs analyze treatment and engagement patterns.

Paper: "From Newcomer to Core: A Comparative Study of Developer Transitions in
OSS and OSS4SG Communities" (Target venue: FSE 2026)


DATA DEFINITIONS & CORE RULES
=============================
- Core contributors per week: smallest set of contributors whose cumulative
  commits account for at least 80% of total commits up to that week (80% rule).
- Time origin for a contributor: the week of their first commit to the project
  in the weekly timeline.
- Time to core (weeks_to_core): first week index when that contributor appears
  in the weekly core set minus their first week index (inclusive semantics are
  handled consistently in our scripts).
- Effort to core (commits_to_core): contributor’s cumulative commit count at
  the first week they become core.
- True newcomers (Step 6 v2): excludes instant core (week 0) and early project
  joiners (first_commit_week ≤ 8) who become core very fast (weeks_to_core ≤ 4).

ENVIRONMENT & DEPENDENCIES
==========================
Python 3.x with:
- pandas, numpy, tqdm
- scipy, seaborn, matplotlib (plots/investigations)

Install (already done locally):
"/Users/mohamadashraf/Desktop/Projects/Newcomers OSS Vs. OSS4SG FSE 2026/.venv/bin/python3" -m pip install pandas numpy tqdm scipy seaborn matplotlib

Large artifacts are ignored by git via .gitignore. Do not commit datasets.


RQ1 END-TO-END PIPELINE (SUMMARY)
=================================
1) Data mining (cloning, commit extraction, consolidation)
   - Lives under `data_mining/`. Produces a master commit dataset (excluded
     from git due to size). Not re-run during Step 5–7 work.

2) Step 5: Weekly datasets (foundation for Steps 6–7)
   - Dataset 1 (project level): weekly core timeline per project (80% rule),
     one row per project-week.
   - Dataset 2 (contributor level): weekly activity per contributor per
     project-week, with cumulative fields and `is_core_this_week`.
   - Output: `step5_weekly_datasets/dataset2_contributor_activity/contributor_activity_weekly.csv`

3) Step 6 (Dataset 3): Contributor transitions (v2)
   - One row per (project, contributor). Captures the journey from first week
     to first core (or censoring), with time and effort metrics.
   - v2 exclusions for true newcomers:
     • Exclude instant core (weeks_to_core = 0)
     • Exclude early joiners (first_commit_week ≤ 8) who become core fast
       (weeks_to_core ≤ 4)
   - Outputs under `step6_contributor_transitions/results/`.

4) Step 7 (Dataset 4): ML features for core prediction
   - Early behavior features from the first 4/8/12 observed weeks, computed
     only from pre-core weeks for positives. Requires ≥12 pre-core weeks.
    - Outputs under `step7_ml_features/results/`.

5) Step 8: Survival analysis (KM + Cox)
    - Builds survival datasets from Step 6 transitions and compares time-to-core dynamics.
    - Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank tests for OSS vs OSS4SG.
    - Cox proportional hazards models to quantify effects and covariates.
    - Outputs under `step8_survival_analysis/results/` with plots in `visualizations/`.

6) Step 9: ML modeling (predictive)
    - Uses Step 7 features to train predictive models of becoming core.
    - Combined and per-type models (OSS, OSS4SG); 5-fold CV; PR-AUC primary metric.
    - Models: Logistic Regression, RandomForest, HistGradientBoosting; calibration via Brier score.
    - Outputs under `step9_ml_modeling/`.


STEP 5 — WEEKLY DATASETS (KEY FIELDS)
=====================================
File: step5_weekly_datasets/dataset2_contributor_activity/contributor_activity_weekly.csv
Columns used downstream:
- project_name, project_type, contributor_email
- week_number, week_date
- commits_this_week, cumulative_commits
- cumulative_lines_changed
- is_core_this_week (derived from Dataset 1 using 80% rule)
- rank_this_week, contribution_percentage

Notes on Dataset 1 (project-level weekly core timeline):
- Used to derive `is_core_this_week` in Dataset 2 via 80% rule; one timeline per
  project enumerating the weekly core set. Not directly edited in recent work.


STEP 6 — DATASET 3: CONTRIBUTOR TRANSITIONS (v2)
================================================
Scripts
- contributor_transitions_analysis_v2.py (main)
- tester/test_transitions_v2.py (validator)
- analyze_early_contributors.py (diagnostic)
- tester/test_commit_requirement_investigation.py (commit gap analysis)
- threshold_analysis.py (exclude cores within ≤X weeks sensitivity)

Inputs
- Step 5 Dataset 2: contributor_activity_weekly.csv

Outputs (under step6_contributor_transitions/results/)
- contributor_transitions.csv (main v2; fully filtered)
- contributor_transitions_no_instant.csv (instant only excluded)
- contributor_transitions_including_all.csv (no exclusions)
- transition_statistics_v2.json (summary)
- validation_report_v2.json
- investigation_results.json, investigation_plots.png (commit-gap study)
- threshold_analysis/*.csv and threshold_analysis_comprehensive.png

Exclusion logic (v2)
- Exclude instant core: weeks_to_core == 0
- Exclude early+fast core: first_commit_week ≤ 8 AND weeks_to_core ≤ 4

Dataset sizes (current run)
- Total processed: 99,350 contributor-project pairs
- Excluded instant core: 13,297
- Excluded early+fast: 290
- Included in main v2: 85,763 transitions
- Became core: 8,812 (10.3%)

Key results (main v2)
- Time to core (weeks):
  • Overall median 48, mean 89.5
  • OSS median 53 (mean 98.5)
  • OSS4SG median 34 (mean 65.2)
- Effort to core (commits):
  • Overall median 12, mean 66.5
  • OSS median 2 (mean 37.8)
  • OSS4SG median 59 (mean 144.1)

Interpretation: Time-to-core is consistently longer for OSS by ~20–30 weeks;
effort-to-core counts are dramatically lower in OSS. This is structural (not a
bug) and concentrated in specific OSS projects (curated lists/docs/squash).

Commit-gap investigation (tester/test_commit_requirement_investigation.py)
- Distribution comparison significant (Mann–Whitney p≈0), with OSS heavy mass
  at ≤5 commits.
- Project-level: 20 OSS projects have median ≤5 commits vs 1 for OSS4SG.
- Suspicious projects: some OSS repos where all core achievers need ≤2 commits.
- Sensitivity: imposing ≥5 commit threshold reduces ratio to ~1.5x but the gap
  persists. Visuals saved in results.

Threshold sweep (exclude cores that occur within ≤W weeks)
- None → medians: OSS 0, OSS4SG 22
- ≤0w (no instant): OSS 52, OSS4SG 32
- ≤1w: 55 vs 35; ≤2w: 58 vs 38; ≤4w: 67 vs 41; ≤8w: 76 vs 47; ≤12w: 82 vs 54;
  ≤26w: 103 vs 74; ≤52w: 132 vs 107
- Conclusion: after removing instant cores, OSS remains ~20–30 weeks slower.

Exploratory visuals (trying some stuf ..)
- commits_to_core hist/CDF/log-violin per type; weeks vs commits heatmaps.

Common issues and fixes in Step 6
- Step number (7→6) and mixed CWDs → standardized relative paths and results/
- Missing libs for plots (seaborn/scipy) → installed in venv
- Tester path assumptions → fixed to read from results/
- Large artifacts in git → expanded .gitignore; do not push datasets

STEP 7 — DATASET 4: ML FEATURES FOR CORE PREDICTION
===================================================
Scripts
- step7_ml_features/ml_feature_extraction.py (extractor)
- step7_ml_features/tester/verify_ml_features.py (verifier)
- README.md (step details)

Inputs
- Activity weekly (Step 5 Dataset 2)
- Transitions (Step 6 v2 main): step6_contributor_transitions/results/contributor_transitions.csv

Labeling and leakage prevention
- Join on (project_name, contributor_email); use `became_core` and
  `first_core_week`.
- For positives, compute features only from pre-core weeks
  (week_number < first_core_week).
- Enforce ≥12 pre-core observed weeks; require ≥3 total commits.

Features (selection)
- First week: commits, lines_changed (derived), rank, contribution_pct
- Windows (4/8/12): totals (commits/lines), active weeks, consistency,
  avg/max/std commits, burst_ratio, trend slope/R², rank start/end/improvement,
  contribution_pct_end, inactive streak metrics
- Temporal patterns: gaps between active weeks (avg/max/std), activity_regularity,
  12w acceleration (late/early)

Derivation notes
- Lines changed per week are computed from cumulative_lines_changed.diff()
  per contributor; the first row uses its cumulative value.

Outputs (step7_ml_features/results/)
- ml_features_dataset.csv (28,430 samples; positives 4,302 = 15.1%)

Verification (tester)
- Schema/base present; no NaNs/Infs in numeric fields
- Key features discriminate (p << 0.01): w1_{4,8,12}_total_commits, activity_regularity

Step 7 output schema (base + examples)
- Base: project_name, project_type, contributor_email, label_became_core,
  weeks_to_core (if available), total_weeks_observed
- First week: w1_commits, w1_lines_changed, w1_rank, w1_contribution_pct

GUIDANCE FOR NORMALIZATION & SENSITIVITIES
==========================================
- Always report raw and log-scale (log10(commits_to_core+1)) for heavy tails.
- Compare project-level medians across types to reduce dominance by large repos.
- Relative-to-project metrics (fold-change vs project median, within-project
  percentile) can contextualize effort.
- Rate metrics (commits_per_active_week, lines_per_active_week) decouple pace
  from duration.
- Cross-check results with lines_changed_to_core to detect commit granularity
  artifacts (e.g., squash merges, docs commits).


COMPLETED RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
============================
RQ1: COMPLETE - Transition rates and speeds analysis
- Community structure analysis: OSS4SG superiority confirmed
- Data mining pipeline: 3.5M commits from 366 projects
- Weekly datasets and contributor transitions analysis
- ML features and survival analysis complete

RQ2: COMPLETE - Newcomer treatment patterns analysis
- Timeline generation: 6,530 contributors, 1,944,698 events
- Treatment metrics: 91 metrics with corrected methodology
- Milestone detection: 7 core milestones with achievement rates
- Major methodological breakthrough: Zero-activity bias corrected

CURRENT PRIORITIES & NEXT STEPS:
================================
1. RQ2-RQ1 Integration (IMMEDIATE)
   - Combine milestone and treatment findings with transition rates
   - Create unified newcomer journey analysis
   - Prepare integrated visualizations for publication

2. Academic Paper Preparation (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Document methodological breakthrough and bias correction
   - Integrate RQ1 and RQ2 findings
   - Prepare publication-ready figures and tables

3. RQ3 Analysis (IN PROGRESS)
   - Engagement patterns analysis (DTW clustering implemented under `RQ3_engagement_patterns/step2.1/`).
   - Work completed so far:
     - Implemented `dtw script withouth interpolatiom.py` with a memory-optimized class `MemoryOptimizedDTWClustering` that:
       * resolves relative input/output paths, loads the full dataset in chunks, preserves variable-length series, scales series, converts to tslearn format, runs DTW k-means, computes silhouette on full padded dataset after NaN handling, and saves visualizations/results.
       * includes optional `psutil` monitoring (fallback to `resource`) and aggressive garbage collection to limit peak memory.
     - Fixed issues encountered: path resolution, passing variable-length lists to `tslearn` (now using `to_time_series_dataset`), and silhouette failures caused by NaNs (now handled by padding/interpolation).
     - Latest run details (filter >=6 active weeks): input contributors 6,530 → valid 4,138; outputs saved to `RQ3_engagement_patterns/step2.1/dtw_clustering_memory_optimized/`.
   - Recommendations / next steps:
     - Add optional preprocessing smoothing (Savitzky-Golay / rolling mean) or switch to Soft-DTW (`metric="softdtw"` with tuned `gamma`) to obtain smoother barycenters.
     - Persist DTW distance matrices for reproducibility if silhouette is required on full dataset.

4. Cross-Validation & Robustness (ONGOING)
   - Verify findings across different analysis approaches
   - Sensitivity analysis for key parameters
   - Replication with different time periods


REPRO & OPERATIONS NOTES
========================
- Always quote base path due to spaces.
- Scripts read in chunks (500k rows) to handle large CSVs.
- Artifacts live in step-specific `results/` and are ignored by git.
- If libraries missing: install into `./.venv` and run with that interpreter.
 - Memory: processing Step 5/6/7 can take minutes and several GB; chunked
   reading prevents OOM. Avoid loading entire CSVs when unnecessary.


CONTACT & CONTRIBUTION RULES
============================
- Keep changes documented here; update run books and READMEs per step.
- Do not commit large CSV/PNG artifacts—regenerate locally.
- Maintain clear, reviewable Python (explicit names, low nesting).

================================================================================

- Geographic Distribution: Global projects
- Domain Coverage: Various application domains

COLLECTION METHODOLOGY:
1. Used GitHub Search API with systematic queries
2. Applied random sampling within each stratum
3. Verified each project against all 5 criteria in real-time
4. Ensured no duplicates with existing dataset
5. Collected until target numbers met for each stratum

API VERIFICATION PROCESS:
- Made ~2,000 GitHub API calls for comprehensive verification
- Checked contributors count, commit history, PR statistics, creation date, last update
- Documented all verification results in: preparing_dataset/verification_results/

FINAL RESULT: 185 OSS + 190 OSS4SG = 375 Total Projects (1:1.03 balance ratio)
